# Decentralized Chat Application
## Phase 1: Research & Planning (Week 1-2)

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives:
- **Define the architecture**: Decide between a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system or a Blockchain-based chat application.
- **Choose the technology stack**: Select the best tools, frameworks, and protocols that support decentralized communication.
- **Identify key features and security measures**: Plan core functionalities such as messaging, media sharing, user authentication, and encryption.

### âœ… Key Requirements:
1. **Understanding of WebRTC or libp2p for P2P Messaging**
   - **WebRTC**: A free, open-source technology that allows peer-to-peer connections, which is useful for direct messaging between users without a centralized server.
   - **libp2p**: A modular network stack that can be used for building decentralized, peer-to-peer applications.

2. **Knowledge of End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Protocols**
   - **Signal Protocol**: Widely used protocol for end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the sender and receiver can read the message.
   - **OpenPGP.js**: A JavaScript library for implementing OpenPGP encryption standards, which can be used for encrypting/decrypting messages and ensuring privacy.

3. **Optional: Ethereum/Solana Smart Contracts for User Authentication**
   - **Ethereum/Solana**: Decentralized blockchains that can be used for implementing smart contracts to manage user identity, authentication, and access controls in a decentralized way.

4. **IPFS or Decentralized Storage for Media Files**
   - **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A decentralized file storage system, which allows users to store and share files like images, videos, and other media in a distributed manner.
