1. Real-Time Messaging
- **One-to-One and Group Chats:**  
  Users should have the capability to create private conversations through the direct messaging feature.  
  Users can generate chat groups or channels through this feature which enables several users to communicate simultaneously in these groups.
  
- **Rich Communication:**  
  The application supports multiple text presentation capabilities together with emojis and valuable symbols to help users convey their thoughts effectively.  
  The application allows users to attach images as well as videos and voice messages and various file types directly to their messages.

- **Offline & Sync Capabilities:**  
  A user can send queued messages during offline periods so they automatically synchronize with the user when they return to the app.  
  Conversation histories and states need to synchronize automatically between different devices as a feature of multi-device availability.

## 2. Decentralized Infrastructure

- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:**  
  Devices should be able to establish direct links between each other to eliminate server dependency.  
  Nodes should use self-organizing network protocols for autonomous discovery and creation of distributed communications.
  
The system enables distributed data routing through peer-to-peer network architecture thus providing data access across multiple devices.  
  To ensure secure message payload storage the system implements decentralized storage platforms including IPFS for temporary data management.  
  The storage system maintains data accessibility through distributed node-based replication of storage.

- **Protocol Integration:**  
  The chat system should implement decentralized protocols through the usage of existing standards such as Matrix protocol or custom protocol development within P2P communication networks.  
  The chat system should utilize protocols able to interface with additional decentralized network and service systems.

## 3. Security & Encryption

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):**  
  Messages within the system use two-way encryption which protects the content from being read by anyone between the sender and recipient.  
  Secure communication demands that the system implements industry-standard encryption standards including the Signal Protocol to maintain robust security.

- **Key Management:**  
  The exchange of encryption keys uses secure decentralized approaches to lower the probability of man-in-the-middle attacks appearing.  
  Users must have access to methods which enable them to control and back up their encryption keys in order to increase privacy management capabilities.

- **Security Audits & Updates:**  
  Security tests and penetration audits combined with code review evaluations should be performed on a regular basis to discover vulnerabilities as well as prevent them.  
  The application should provide an automatic system to update both security protocols and encryption libraries so user experience remains unaffected.
