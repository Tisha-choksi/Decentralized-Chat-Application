##1. Real-Time Messaging
- **One-to-One and Group Chats:**  
  Users should have the capability to create private conversations through the direct messaging feature.  
  Users can generate chat groups or channels through this feature which enables several users to communicate simultaneously in these groups.
  
- **Rich Communication:**  
  The application supports multiple text presentation capabilities together with emojis and valuable symbols to help users convey their thoughts effectively.  
  The application allows users to attach images as well as videos and voice messages and various file types directly to their messages.

- **Offline & Sync Capabilities:**  
  A user can send queued messages during offline periods so they automatically synchronize with the user when they return to the app.  
  Conversation histories and states need to synchronize automatically between different devices as a feature of multi-device availability.

## 2. Decentralized Infrastructure

- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:**  
  Devices should be able to establish direct links between each other to eliminate server dependency.  
  Nodes should use self-organizing network protocols for autonomous discovery and creation of distributed communications.
  
The system enables distributed data routing through peer-to-peer network architecture thus providing data access across multiple devices.  
  To ensure secure message payload storage the system implements decentralized storage platforms including IPFS for temporary data management.  
  The storage system maintains data accessibility through distributed node-based replication of storage.

- **Protocol Integration:**  
  The chat system should implement decentralized protocols through the usage of existing standards such as Matrix protocol or custom protocol development within P2P communication networks.  
  The chat system should utilize protocols able to interface with additional decentralized network and service systems.

## 3. Security & Encryption

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):**  
  Messages within the system use two-way encryption which protects the content from being read by anyone between the sender and recipient.  
  Secure communication demands that the system implements industry-standard encryption standards including the Signal Protocol to maintain robust security.

- **Key Management:**  
  The exchange of encryption keys uses secure decentralized approaches to lower the probability of man-in-the-middle attacks appearing.  
  Users must have access to methods which enable them to control and back up their encryption keys in order to increase privacy management capabilities.

- **Security Audits & Updates:**  
  Security tests and penetration audits combined with code review evaluations should be performed on a regular basis to discover vulnerabilities as well as prevent them.  
  The application should provide an automatic system to update both security protocols and encryption libraries so user experience remains unaffected.

# 4. User Identity Management

## Self-Sovereign Identity
- The system ought to let users establish their identity profiles independently from any central authority.
- Users should have the option to stay anonymous or use false names in order to match the platform's main purpose of privacy-focused activities.

## Reputation & Verification Systems
- Relationship Authentication Systems should include reputation evaluation tools that let users determine trustworthy contacts without risking decentralization systems.

## Flexible Authentication Methods
- For better account security, the system should accept multiple authentication methods that combine biometric data with hardware verification tools.
- Radio is account recovery creating safe retrieval methods which protect decentralization and privacy.

# 5. File Sharing & Media Support

## Seamless Media Integration
- Users can maintain attachment functions through messaging by sending files consisting of images, videos, documents, and all other media types.
- The software enables instant media content previewing through built-in viewers directly inside its chat interface.

## Decentralized Storage Options
- The application supports IPFS file storage to provide distributed, safe, secure, and redundant file retrieval for shared media.
- Staff should use dual protection to keep transmitted media along with medium storage on decentralized networks encrypted.

## 6. Additional Functionalities

## User Presence & Notifications
- The platform shows status symbols to notify participants about their online or offline availability as well as away status.
- The system should send push alerts instantly after receiving new messages and delivering crucial announcements to users.

## Search & History Management
- The system allows users to perform search queries that go through all previous messages alongside media files.
- A message archiving system should provide methods for saving important messages into an easily retrievable storage or creating special pinned sections.

## Customization & Accessibility
- The application enables users to personalize their interface presentation by selecting themes combined with layout preferences which enhance user interface functionality.
- Users with disabilities should have convenient access to the application when screen readers function together with high-contrast themes and keyboard-based navigation options.

## Moderation & Community Controls
- Empower users throughout the community by developing automated content moderation tools which enable them to keep track of abusive content.
- The system enables support for third-party integrations through automation bots and polling options as well as supplementary services.

## Multi-Language & Global Support
- The application should include support for various languages together with regional format standards to serve global users effectively.
